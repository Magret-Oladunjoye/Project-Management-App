user Controller needs to get access to user service so controller can attempt to delete users, update, fetch, etc

user controller also needs to make use of new auth service for sign up and sign in users

Auth service needs to create and query users so it needs the user service

Aurth service wont use users repo directy but will use functionality exposed inside the user service
